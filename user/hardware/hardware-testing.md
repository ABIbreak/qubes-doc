title: Hardware testing
---

The Qubes developers test Qubes OS on certain hardware models. The tested
hardware described on this page differs from [certified
hardware](/doc/certified-hardware/) in a few key ways:

- Certified hardware has to meet more demanding standards than hardware that is
  merely tested.
- All certified hardware is tested, but not all tested hardware is certified.
- A specific certified configuration is guaranteed to be supported on specific
  versions of Qubes OS, whereas hardware testing provides no guarantees.

In general, you can think of tested hardware as "unofficial recommended"
hardware. Here's an overview of the various hardware lists:

- [Certified hardware](/doc/certified-hardware/) --- Qubes developer certified,
  officially recommended
- Hardware testing (this page) --- Qubes developer tested, unofficially
  recommended
- [Laptops that "just work" with Qubes
  OS](https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/laptops-that-just-work-with-qubes-os-r4-0-4/5560)
  --- community-curated list, unofficially recommended
- [Hardware compatibility list (HCL)](/hcl/) --- community test results,
  neither recommended nor disrecommended

## Tested Models

These hardware models have been (and continue to be) tested and work well with
Qubes OS:

- Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 5 (i7-7600U)
- Lenovo ThinkPad x230 (i7-3520M)

Note: The Lenovo X and T series are similar enough to assume similar
compatibility of the matching model from the other series.

## Desired Models

The Qubes devs would like to test these models, but the hardware is not
available to us. If anyone is willing to lend or donate these models to us, we
would be happy to test them:

- Lenovo Thinkpad T or X series with Intel 8th Gen CPU and integrated graphics
- Dell Latitude with Intel 8th Gen CPU and integrated graphics

Note: The Lenovo X and T series are similar enough to assume similar
compatibility of the matching model from the other series.
