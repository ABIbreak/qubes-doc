title: How to upgrade to Qubes 4.1
---

This page explains how to perform an in-place upgrade from Qubes 4.0 to Qubes 4.1. It is not possible to upgrade directly from releases earlier than 4.0. If you're still on an earlier release, please either perform a [clean installation of 4.1](#clean-installation) or [upgrade to 4.0](/doc/upgrade/4.0/) first.

## Back up

Before attempting either an in-place upgrade or a clean installation, we strongly recommend that you first [back up your system](/doc/how-to-back-up-restore-and-migrate/).

## Clean installation

If you would prefer to perform a clean installation rather than upgrading in-place:

1. Create a [backup](/doc/how-to-back-up-restore-and-migrate/#creating-a-backup) of your current installation.
2. Follow the [installation guide](/doc/installation-guide/) to install Qubes 4.1.
3. [Restore from your backup](/doc/how-to-back-up-restore-and-migrate/#restoring-from-a-backup) on your new 4.1 installation.

## In-place upgrade

TODO

## Update

After upgrading or performing a clean installation, we strongly recommend [updating your system](/doc/how-to-update/).
